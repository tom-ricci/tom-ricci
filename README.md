# Hey, I'm Thomas.
I'm a 17 year old developer with experience in a variety of frontend and backend languages, frameworks, and libraries. I have experience with Java, TS, JS, HTML, CSS, Python, and more. I use Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, Octobox, and others on the frontend, and Node, npm, Express, Serve, and Pterodactyl on the backend.
